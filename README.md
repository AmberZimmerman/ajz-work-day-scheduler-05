This is a day planner that allows a user to schedule in tasks. The user can click into a field and type in the task for that hour, then click on the floppy disk to save it to local storage. The task will then still be there when the user refreshes. The rows that contain the text information is color coded in a way that corresponds with the hour of the day. If the hour is current, it will be red. If the hour is in the future, it will be green. If the hour is in the past, it will reveal a portion of a photo of Dolly Parton. When the workday is over and all the hours are in the past, a full picture of Dolly Parton is revealed as a surprise. 


The image below shows the Day Planner when it is in the middle of the day. The different colors represent the past, present, and future time.
